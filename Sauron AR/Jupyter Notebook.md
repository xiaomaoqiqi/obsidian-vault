Automated AR

There are quite many python wrapper actually as part of [https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BenderLib](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/BenderLib) - For SIM I use BenderLibSIM and OpResSDK (which has a SIM wraper over BenderLibSIM as well) [https://code.amazon.com/packages/OpResSDK/blobs/mainline/--/src/opres_sdk/sim.py](https://code.amazon.com/packages/OpResSDK/blobs/mainline/--/src/opres_sdk/sim.py)

both are loaded by default in AR

Examples: 

https://ar.security.aws.dev/user-redirect/lab/tree/shared/OpRes/OpResTPMHelper/Check_labels_table_content_against_SIM_API.ipynb
and everything in this folder
