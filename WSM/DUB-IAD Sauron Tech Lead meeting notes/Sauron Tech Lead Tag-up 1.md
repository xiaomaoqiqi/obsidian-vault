Outcome: Michael Qu to add more clarifying details in the ticket for SecDevOps team. Rick Murphy to also comment on the FR and weigh in on importance of feature.

-   Merge TPMHelper and Sauron’s DW for helping TPMs consolidate metrics.

Outcome: Will Pennell to submit an FR and a PRFAQ . Sandy’s FR should be taken care of in this FR.

-   There were a few points for clarification that SecDevOps had for some FRs .

Outcome: The required stakeholders weren’t present during this call. SecDevOps will reach out to the appropriate stakeholders off line .
