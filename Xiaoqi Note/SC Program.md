# Program Expectations

Once you have completed training, the Security Certifier(SC) program expects participants to abide by the following:

-   Security Certifiers In-Training (SCITs) are to find a (1) Red review within **6 months** after training completion.  The within 6 weeks of training rule was removed in early 2021.  If you receive an email from Anvil stating otherwise it is _due_ to the complex structure inside of Anvil this email still goes out occasionally After training is completed. 
-   SCITs will be listed as available within Security Reviewer Assignment and Management ([SRAM](https://sram.review-tooling.security.amazon.dev/9017b135-3c35-417b-99b3-9c3806e2997d/securityCertifier/profile)) within 2 business days of being updated in Anvil. For more information on SRAM, see the [Wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Infosec/Proactive_Security/Dev/SecurityReviewTooling/Certifier).  You will need to update your profile in [SRAM](https://sram.review-tooling.security.amazon.dev/9017b135-3c35-417b-99b3-9c3806e2997d/securityCertifier/profile) to be linked with compatible apps.
-   SCITs undergo a Review Audit (RA) to ensure the security review bar is met. Once a SCIT's first Red application review is **complete**, submit a [SIM-T](https://t.corp.amazon.com/create/templates/c5f0c1e7-6205-41fd-ad87-aa0a570fcd14) [](https://tt.amazon.com/quicklink/Q000230049)to initiate the RA.  There is a 2 week SLA for completion of the RA from the InfoSec Security Engineers.  Please plan this into your certification timeline. Passing the RA is how a SCIT become a full-fledged SC. Visit the [RA wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Infosec/Security_Certifier_Program/Review_Audits/) for more information.
-   Complete 1 review per calendar year to maintain active status in the program.

### How to Find a Red Application to Review

There are a few ways to find a Red Application: 

-   Complete your profile in SRAM so the system can help match you with an app.
-   Subscribe to security-certifier-interest@amazon.com for regular review requests from application owners and responding to a request for a certifier is a proactive way of connecting for an app.
-   Look for reviews posted on security certifier Slack channels #security-certifier or #security-certifier-in-training.
-   Visit the Red Application Dashboard in [**Anvil**](https://anvil.amazon.com/red_apps/jeff) follow these [**Instructions**](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Certifier_Availability_Tool/Certifier_Availability_Tool_FAQs#How_do_I.2C_a_Security_Certifier.2C_request_an_Anvil_application_for_review.3F)

Please note: some applications may have aggressive timelines to launch. Don’t let this deter you! Every application is different pending complexity and where the team is in the process, this may be an unrealistic timeline to complete. On average it takes about 3 months to do the full red application security review. Some can take less or longer pending availability, workload, etc. As part of the planning process, I recommend you and the team work with the Certifier to draft the schedule of who does what and also build in some time for any potential risks, dependencies, vacations, holidays, resource workload, etc. to give you all a good idea if you’re tracking to your desired drop dead date. Once you’re aligned on the timing, if you find your completion date needs to be extended, please make sure to reset expectations with all the stakeholders and customers involved.
