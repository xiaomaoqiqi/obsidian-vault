**Session 1: Putting the Guardian Runbooks into Practice (Sep 13, 6pm ET or Sep 15, 2022, 10am ET)**

During this session, an experienced AWS Guardian or AppSec Engineer will walk through the Guardian review process using past security reviews they have completed. They will highlight best practices, things to look out for, and common mistakes to help you prepare for your first review.

*Prereq: Read the [Guardian runbooks](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_IT_Security/AWS_Guardians/Runbooks/)

  

**Session 2: Raising the Bar on Threat Modeling (Sep 20, 6pm ET or Sep 22, 11am ET)**

As a Guardian you are not responsible for completing the threat model from scratch, but instead for helping the team improve the quality of their threat model. In this session, you will be guided through the process of assessing a completed threat model, identifying opportunities for improvement, and how to effectively provide feedback that results in a higher quality threat model.

*Pre-req: Completed [Threat Modeling the Right Way for Amazon Builders](https://knet.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/course/ab60bd07-994c-41a2-b8b9-e6eae9336fe3)

  

**Session 3: Guardians role in finding severity and management (Sep 27 6pm ET or Sep 29, 10am ET)**

During this session, an experienced Guardian or AppSec engineer will guide you through their role in finding severity and management. They will also discuss what AppSec looks for from both the service teams and Guardians when they are reviewing the findings during their security reviews. They will highlight what to look for when performing your Guardian evaluation, how to capture your inputs and feedback effectively, and how to support escalations when need.

*Prereq: Read the [Finding Severity Runbook](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_IT_Security/AWS_Guardians/Runbooks/FindingSeverity/)

  

**Session 4: How Guardians yield better customer experiences (Oct 4 6pm ET or Oct 6, 10am ET)**

During this session, you will learn how customers generally approach and reason about building securely on AWS. This perspective enables Guardians to provide meaningful inputs on the design of features and services so that they better meet our customers broader security expectations, taking into consideration how the new service or feature will relate to a customer’s use of AWS.
