SecOps flag Saurons Process

1. All the Sev2 tickets submitted thru t.corp will be automatically imported to Watchlist -> Queue

2. SecOps meet up daily to triage the issues

3. They flag the issues with status as leadership review, top rope, staypuft, WOZ etc. These issues will be later presented during the selection meetings. other issues just dropped if deemed not serious

4. before the first selection meeting, Pillera and sec engineers vote each Sauron in watchlist -> dashboard, the score is calculated based on the votes

5. Lastly, during the selection meeting, issues are sorted by score and presented to the leaders.

How to effectively flag a Sauron?

1. Custom impact matters, but not the sole reason to flag the issue

2. for each Sauron in queue, review the summary, impact, communicates from attached t-crop ticket (we can access those tickets as well from sim ticket system). If the service team is not aligned how to proper handle the issue or pushing back, or don't even consider it as security issue, those will be flagged as well

3. for the issues that are happening repetitively such as Tagris issue if you all remember, these issues will be flagged too.

4. WSM Writeups -> naming convention is confusing, however this dashboard is just give a holistic view of the status (staypuft, top rope etc.) , who owns the doc write up since each team has their own security meeting scheduled. I think the writeups wonâ€™t be as formal as WSM, just similar like Staypuft simplified version of WSM.
